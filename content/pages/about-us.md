## What we do
We post news, articles and resources. Yes, we know that can do that anywhere and on any platform. However, with the increasing percentage of paid services such as [premium articles](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/24/medium_five_bucks_a_month_for_nothing/), and [biased search results](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/22/steven-crowder-shares-chilling-youtube-behavior-am/), we decided that it is best for us to control the medium and have a central place for all our content.

Also, we don't do ads.

## Why we do it
1. To reinforce our learning. 

Not going to lie, we mostly we do it for ourselves. We truly believe that the best way to learn is to teach others. If others benefit from the stuff we post then all the better, but you're not our priority. We find many tech articles and tutorials are getting longer and longer and miss the point, so we try to keep them concise.

2. For a better world.

There's a lot of terrible things going on in the world of technology, and governments either [can't seem to keep up with regulation](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/02/government-cant-keep-up-with-technologys-growth/), or they try to [use it to their advantage](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/9/20799022/facial-recognition-law). We do our best to abide by our moral code and emphasize common sense, because it often seems that some people are losing it.

3. To pay it forward.

Simply put, we are aficionados of open source code and free access to information. The more people that contribute to the cause, the better, and we are just doing our part. Hopefully you will too.

## Where & When
Anywhere we have internet access, whenever we have free time. Although, [we're not vampires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZe-qzSk3pw) so sometimes we like to kick back with a beer and enjoy the sun as well.
